# CHAT-SERVER-GUI-PYTHON
A socket programming GUI chat server in python (PART 1) and advanced chat server : console based (PART 2)

## SYNOPSIS
This project is divided into 2 individual components :-
- GUI Chat Server, and
- Advanced Chat Server

The ```GUI Chat Server``` is a simple GUI implementation of chat server which uses Socket programming technique. It also allows to transfer a simple text file from client to client. All the operations from the client are notified to server.

The ```Advanced Chat Server``` is a console based implementation of chat server wherein, the admin(server) can ban or remove an user in the chat room. Also details in this regard will be stored in a text file.

## DESCRIPTION
- Both the components uses Server IP address and server defined 5 digit PORT number to connect 2 or more clients together.
- In both the components client and server can work on same system or can work on ```two or more systems``` too!! (For eg: One PC ay act as server and 2 other PCs may act as client!!)
- Use of tkinter for GUI application for real time experience.
- User can also choose their own username when they come to the chat window.

## INSTRUCTIONS
- Requires ```Python3``` and ```tkinter``` for GUI chat server.
- Requires internet connection. If working on the ```same system```, please run ```ipconfig``` in cmd and copy the IPV4 address under ```Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi:```
- Copy this IP address to both the server.py files in the respective components.
- To work on ```2 or more systems```, one system should act as server and other systems should act as client. Before anything, the server and client should connect to the ```same internet source/hotspot``` and then run ```ipconfig``` in cmd of server PC and then copy the IPV4 address under ```Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi:```
- Copy this IP address to both server.py files in the respective components.
